README file for LBR

This package implements a benchmark approach, LBR (Lo et al, ICWS'2012), for 
Web service QoS prediction. Specifically, we implement the "diverse location
-based regularization (LBR2)" approach, because it shows better performance 
than the other approach (LBR1), as indicated in the paper.

implemented algorithms:

  Web Service QoS Prediction with Location-Based Regularization," in Proc.

Dependencies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org)
- Cython 0.20.1 (http://cython.org)
- numpy 1.8.1 (http://www.scipy.org)
- scipy 0.13.3 (http://www.scipy.org)

The implementations are based on a combination of Python and C++ programming 
languages, in order to achieve both speed and simplicity. To do so, Cython is 
used. The core algorithms are implemented using C++, and we obtain a large 
speedup than pure Python implementation. You can refer to the README.md of 
WSRec repository for instructions of installing Cython. But you do not need 
it if you only want to reproduce the experimental results by executing the 
scripts that I have provided (You may even not need any execution because 
we have also provided most of the results). Cython is only required when you 
modify the c++ source files and want to re-compile them. 

It is worth noting that our implementation is also based on numpy and scipy 
packages, so you would also need to install these packages first.

Usage of this package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For ease of reproducing and compare with other approaches, we provide the 
detailed experimental results with five metrics (MAE, NMAE, RMSE, MRE, NPRE), 
under the "result/" directory, after running the above QoS prediction approach
on the dataset: "data/dataset#1". E.g.,"result/rtResult_0.05.txt" records the 
evaluation results under matrix density = 5%. In particular, each experiment 
is run for 20 times and the average result (including std value) is reported. 
These results can be directly used for your research work.

On the other hand, if you want to reproduce our experiments, you can run the 
program with our provided Python scripts "run_rt.py" and "run_tp.py". You can
also turn on the "parallelMode" in the config area for speedup if you use a 
multi-core computer.

>> python run_rt.py
>> python run_tp.py

Make sure the external module "core.so" exists. If not, you can build it by 
the follow command. Note that whereas our code is executable to different 
platforms, we has only tested the current version on Linux.

>> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
